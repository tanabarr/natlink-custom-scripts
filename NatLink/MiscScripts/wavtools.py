# wavtools.py
#
# A collection of routines which help in dealing with NIST wave files.
#
#----------
# File Formats
#
# The file format used by speech researchs for recorded speech is called a
# NIST wave file.  Although outside of Dragon, NIST wave files usually have
# an extension of ".wav", Dragon Systems uses an extension of ".nwv" to
# avoid confusing NIST wave files with Microsoft wave files.
#
# Audio files recorded under Microsoft Windows (ex: using the sound
# recorder) are in a format called RIFF wave format and have a standard
# extension or ".wav".
#
# Microsoft (RIFF) wave files are just one big block of recorded speech
# including silence as well.  Each RIFF wave file has a single header
# followd by the speech data.
#
# NIST wave files, on the other hand, break the speech up into utterances
# which are blocks of speech which were separated by silence when they were
# recorded.  NIST wave files are a concatented list of single utterances
# where each utterance has a header followed by the wave data.
#
# The binary data is compatible between RIFF and NIST wave files but the
# headers are not.  It is theoreticly possible to replace the header in a
# RIFF wave file to get a NIST wave file but then the NIST wave file would
# contain just one utterance even if the RIFF wave file represents many
# utterances with interveening silence.
#
#----------
# Word Spelling Conventions
#
# Words as returned by Dragon NaturallySpeaking in results objects are
# spelled according to SAPI spelling conventions.  SAPI spelling conventions
# allow for internal spaces.  However, some of Dragon's analysis tools do
# not deal with words which have internal spaces since they assume that the
# space character is used as a word separator in a string.
#
# Instead, for post processing of results, we use a different spelling
# convention for sords called the SDAPI format (for historical reasons). The
# basic idea is to replace spaces with underscores.  The actual
# transformation rules are as follows.  This is a reversable transformation.
#
#   SAPI --> SDAPI
#   ' '  --> '_'
#   '~'  --> '~~'
#   '_'  --> '~_'
#
# Some programs also escape right parens ')' -> '~)'.  This optional and is
# not done by this program but the reverse transform handles it fine.
#
#----------
# This file contains the following utility functions.
#
# convertWord(word)
#   returns a string which represents the input word converted from SAPI to
#   SDAPI format.  In other words, spaces are replaced by underscores.
#
# convertBack(word)
#   reverse of convertWord, returns the original SAPI format word.
#
# formatNistWave(file,riffWave,transcription,speaker,dateTime)
#   Converts an utterances from Microsoft RIFF wave format into NIST wave
#   format, and returns a string which is the NIST wave format of that
#   utterance.
#
#   The riffWave usually comes from a call to ResObj.getWave() although
#   it can come from a wav file as long as the wav file was recorded in the
#   correct format (16 bit, 11.025KHz, mono).
#
#   The transcription, speaker and dateTime are all optional and will be
#   included in the NIST wave header.  The dateTime should be a standard
#   Python time value (seconds since EPOC).
#
# loadNistFile(fileName)
#   Opens a NIST wave file and returns a list of NistWave objects
#   which correspond to the contents of the file.
#
# saveNistFile(fileName,waves)
#   Creates a new NIST wave file and writes out the NistWave objects.
#   This is the reverse of loadNistFile.  Warning: the header fields
#   may be written in a different order then when they were loaded.
#
# class NistWave
#   Class which encapuslates a NIST wave header and data.  An instance
#   of this class has a number of data members which directly represent
#   the data from the header.  This list includes (usually):
#       channel_count (integer)
#       sample_count (integer)
#       sample_n_bytes (integer)
#       sample_byte_format (string)
#       sample_coding (string)
#       sample_checksum (integer)
#       sample_rate (integer)
#       speaker_name (string)
#       recognized_text (string)
#       record_time (string)
#   Access these data members using dictionary lookup.  For example:
#       value = nist['channel_count']
#
#   The binary data is stored in a string attribute called "data".
#
#   You can create a NistWave object from a binary string using the
#   load function.  Pass in a binary buffer with offset to the start
#   of the data.  This function returns an offset past the data used.
#
#   Use the dump() function to get a binary string which represents
#   the Nist wave data for writing into a file.
