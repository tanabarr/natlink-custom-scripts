Release notes for NatLink/Vocola/Unimacro combined installer 3.7india:


New in Vocola version 2.6.4:

* fixed problem with "Edit Commands" command (opening a .vcl file)

* Command sequences work again for DNS 7.0 and later; complicated
  grammars may require limiting the maximum number of commands per
  utterance, however, with these versions of DNS.

* Command sequences can be turned on/off/limited on a per .vcl file
  basis.

New in Vocola version 2.6.3:

* Problem wiht NatSpeak crashes when opening a Vocola command file probably solved, by changing os.startfile with win32api calls

* Unimacro actions can now be called from Vocola commands if Unimacro
  has been installed.

* Commands are recognized faster because the Vocola compiler is run
  during recognition only if at least one file in a Vocola command
  folder has been changed/added.

* Python 2.5 is now supported.


New in the combined NatLink/Vocola/Unimacro installer:

* open config program can be started through a .bat file, for elevated mode in Vista or Windows 7

* automatic loading of changed Vocola command files is working properly
  again (no extra steps like toggling the microphone required)

* Vocola command files are automatically associated with the Notepad editor.

* The command line configuration program has clearer built-in instructions.


New in Unimacro:
* doMouse commands now can be in multiple monitors, the module monitorinfo now simpler and more reliable.

* Mostly small adaptations to make Unimacro/Vocola integration work.

* Unimacro website revised in a lot of spots.

* The actions.ini file is not overwritten anymore in this release.
  Check for changes with the version in the sample_ini directory of
  unimacro, if you encounter problems. More info in the unimacro website.

Changed in NatLink (for programmers only):

* added throughWords in SelectGramBase, in order to make more "throughWords" possible (see natlinkutils.py)
* The internal dictionary entry that gives the (Natlink) UserDirectory in natlinkstatus.getNatlinkStatusDict() 
  has been capitalized now, so changed from 'userDirectory' into 'UserDirectory'.  As long as you obtain this 
  value through natlinkstatus.getUserDirectory() no change will be noticed.
  Note: there are lots of variables (eg in natlinkmain) called 'userDirectory'.
