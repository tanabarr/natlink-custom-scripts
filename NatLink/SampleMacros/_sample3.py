# Python Macro Language for Dragon NaturallySpeaking

# This sample macro file was created for my talk to the Boston Voice Users
# group on November 9, 1999.  It is explained in my PowerPoint slides.
#
# _sample3.py
#
# This is a sample macro file used to demonstrate how NatLink calls result
# functions (gotResults_xxx) based on which words were recognized.
#
# When NatSpeak has the focus, say "demo sample three now please".  When the
# command is recognized, this code should type:
#   Saw <ruleOne> = ['demo']
#   Saw <ruleTwo> = ['sample','three']
#   Saw <ruleOne> = ['now','please']
#
# Notice that gotResults_ruleOne is called twice because it is called for
# each continugous set of words in the recognition which come from that
# rule.  gotResults_mainRule is never called because that rule has no words.
# See natlinkutils.py for more documentation.
