 * Subject: Installation for multiple installs of DNS?
 * 
 * I use a dual installation of DNS6 and DNS8. I noticed that the
 * installation script now allows for toggling Vocola on/off. That helps
 * a lot. It would be great if you could also choose the installation of
 * DNS you wanted to use especially whether Vocola is toggled on/off for
 * either one of them. It turns out there are some lingering
 * incompatibility problems with DNS8 vs. Vocola as opposed to DNS6 and
 * vocola.
