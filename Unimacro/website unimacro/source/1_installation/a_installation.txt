Installation of NatLink/Vocola 2/Unimacro

 Release 4.1mike is now available: link(http://sourceforge.net/projects/natlink/files/natlink/natlinktest4.1/setup-natlink-4.1mike.exe/download, release 4.1mike)
- Extra checks for missing modules in start_configurenatlink.py
- Unimacro folders grammar: link(/grammars/globalgrammars/folders/trackfoldershistory.html, recent folders option) and link(/grammars/globalgrammars/folders/details.html, support for xplorer2).
- Now recognises also Draglon 13 (Beta), including 12.80, returning 13 as version numberl
- Adapted playString function (SendInput by Mark Lillibridge) via natlinkutils.playString
- natlinkmain.py has nearly all code caught in a try except statement

-There is some backward compatibility broken, see page about link(/installation/technicaldetails/natlinkutils.html, *natlinkutils*).
-There were some problems with the natlink.pyd (=dll) file last few months, we hope this problem is over now.
-The Messages window (popping up when you start Dragon and have configured NatLink) now has the window title *Messages from NatLink - built 01/01/2014*. 
-The new release of Vocola 2, 2.8.1I+, is included.
-Unimacro has new features: link(/features/autohotkey/index.html, *AutHotkey support*) (also usable with Vocola) and
link(/features/actions/actionclassesforapplications.html, *action classes for applications*).
-The grammar link(/grammars/globalgrammars/lines/index.html, _lines) has in some application now the *line numbers modulo hundred* possibility.
-You do not need to uninstall anything before you install this new release. Run the configure program and then restart Dragon.
-Works with Python 2.6 and Python 2.7
-NatLink for Dragon 12 does NOT work in Python 2.5 any more.
-The installation of Python 2.5 in Windows 8 probably has complications, so please take Python 2.6 or Python 2.7.
-Test results are still welcome.
-link(/aboutunimacro/donation/index.html, *Donations*) are very welcome.
-Have a look at some demo video's:

 For Dragon 11 and before: either install link(http://sourceforge.net/projects/natlink/files/natlink/natlink4.0/setup-natlink-4.0.exe/download, Release 4.0), but you are probably better off with above mentioned beta release.

-For most functionality, the *4.1mike* release can be installed too, lots of little changes have been made.
-Some improvements in configure program
-Stable with most things of Dragon 11.
-Stable with Vocola 2.7.2+I.
-Several grammars of Unimacro need a revision still... 
-Works with Python2.5 and Python2.6 (recommended).


-The files are in the link("http://sourceforge.net/projects/natlink/files", "*NatLink repository*"). Click on the different "buttons" in case the links below do not work.

   Installing Python2.7
-Download link(http://sourceforge.net/projects/natlink/files/pythonfornatlink/python2.7.zip/download, *Python Needed for NatLink 2.7*).  This is a self-extracting zip file. 
-Run the self-extracting executable to unzip the installers to a temporary folder.
-Install *Python* (for all users, which is the default)
-Install the three other packager, the *windows extensions*, *wxPython* and (only needed for VoiceCode) *PyXML*.
-*Warning*: NatLink does not work when you install a "64 bit" python version.

 
   Installing Python2.6 
-Download link(http://sourceforge.net/projects/natlink/files/pythonfornatlink/python2.6.zip/download, *Python Needed for NatLink 2.6*).  This is a self-extracting zip file. 
-Run the self-extracting executable to unzip the installers to a temporary folder and install the different items, starting with python-2.6.4.msi.
-*Warning*: NatLink does not work when you install a "64 bit" python version.


   Download and install NatLink/Vocola 2/Unimacro

-Download the combined installer as given above.
-Run the downloaded file.
-Install on *C:\NatLink* (or *D:\NatLink* or any other drive of your choice). Installing in "C:\Program files\NatLink" is *NOT* advised any more.

 Directory layout after installation
 
When you installed at *C:\NatLink* you will get the following directory structure:
-NatLink and Vocola 2 are in *C:\NatLink\NatLink*,
-Unimacro is in *C:\NatLink\Unimacro* (this will be the default *UserDirectory* if you Enable Unimacro)
-The core directory is *C:\NatLink\NatLink\MacroSystem\core* (the "controlling" NatLink files are located here)
-Internally the compiled Vocola 2 files will go in *C:\NatLink\NatLink\MacroSystem* (this is the baseDirectory of NatLink. Unimacro or Vocola 2 users usually do not need to put files into this directory).
-In case you cannot find your configuration program (the GUI): it is located in *C:\NatLink\NatLink\confignatlinkvocolaunimacro*. The configuration (GUI) program is the file "configurenatlink.pyw".
