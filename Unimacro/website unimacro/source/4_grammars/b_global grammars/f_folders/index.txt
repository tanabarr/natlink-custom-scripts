Switching to folders, opening files, websites

:en:

With the grammar *folders* (module file *_folders.py*) you switch to one of your predefined drives, folders or files or to one of your favourite websites.

You can also call subfolders or files of:
-Specified directories; see bottom of link(details.html, details), and:
-If a *This computer window* or a *Open* or *Save as* dialog is active, the folders and files of the current directory are available.

The behaviour is different for different groups of windows:
-If you are in a dialog window (Open, Save As) you switch to the wanted folder inside this window.
-If you are outside a dialog window, the desired folder is opened into a "This Computer" (or explorer) window (See link("details.html", "more details") for this folders switching strategy).
-With the additional command word *paste* you can print the path of the folder or file to your active application
-With the additional command word *new* you can open a new "This Computer" window.

You can show the grammar with the command *show folders*. With *edit folders* you can change your *folders* list, *files* list or other parameters of the grammar.

 Using environment variables
In the definition of folders, files and virtual drives you can now use environment variables like *%HOME%*,  *%PROGRAMFILES%* or *%APPDATA%*. It is also possible to use *~* instead of *%HOME%*.

See 
link("environmentvariables.html", "the page about using these environment variables").


 When editing your folders you will see the following inifile sections:

:TABLE firstcoldifferent=1, border=1:
:HEADING:section
:COL:comment

:ROW:files
:COL:Here you can define your _filelist_.  Delete all the unwanted entries, and enter a word (spoken form) on the left, and the filename on the right.  You can make use of *virtualdrives* (below) and of entries from the folders list. 

*/* is translated into *\*.

:ROW:folders
:COL:Here you can define your _folderlist_.  Delete all the unwanted entries, and enter a word (spoken form) on the left, and the folder name on the right.  You can make use of *virtualdrives* (below)
