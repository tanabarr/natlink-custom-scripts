Environment variables

For all definitions you can now also use the Windows system environment variables.  Enclose with _%_ and *all capitalise* them.  Its sensible use is to put them at the front of a file, folder or virtual drive definition. Slashes can be omitted.

Currently relevant are:

:TABLE firstcoldifferent=1, border=1:

:HEADING:Variable
:COL:Meaning

:ROW:%HOME%

~
:COL:pointing to your home folder, most often your path to My documents, see below

Tilde is a common shorthand notation for your home folder. 

:ROW:%PROGRAMFILES%
:COL:pointing to the program files folder

:ROW:%APPDATA%
:COL: pointing to your app data folder

:ROW:%DESKTOP%
:COL: probably NO environment variable, but added, and pointing to your desktop folder.

 HOME and ~
The environment variable *%HOME%* is by default NOT set in Windows.  In order to make the story above work, Unimacro takes for *%HOME%*: the *My documents* folder on your system.

Of course you can also set *%HOME%*d:\sites\ yourself (in System properties, Advanced, Environment variables). 
When you are using Emacs (VoiceCode) you probably have set the *%HOME%* variable this way in order to get proper access to your *.emacs* file.

For *~* also this folder is taken.

:COL:all pointing to the folder "private" in your documents
