Implementation details

 actions.ini
 
In the inifile *actions.ini* the implementation for different programs is realized. When you call *edit actions* this file will open for inspection and editing.

 gotoline n

The basic action for jumping to a line is the link(/features/actions/metaactions.html, meta-action) *gotoline n*, called from the lines grammar with the wanted line number for *n*.

In the default section you will find:

:CODE:
[default]
(...)
gotoline n = {Ctrl+ExtHome}{ExtDown n}{ExtUp}
::

So when there is no other way to jump to a line, you simply go to the top and then down the needed number of lines.

Here are some applications which do it another way:

:CODE:
[emacs]
gotoline n = EMACS goto-line; n{enter}

[excel]
gotoline n = {ctrl+g}; n:n{enter}

[pythonwin]
gotoline n = {ctrl+g}; n{enter}; {home}

[textpad]
gotoline n = {ctrl+g}; n{enter}

[uedit32]
gotoline n = {ctrl+g}; n{enter}

[win32pad]
gotoline n = {ctrl+g}; n{enter}
::

Note: the excel action is overridden by the function *metaaction_gotoline* in the link(/features/actions/actionclassesforapplications.html, excel actions class module).


 line numbers modulo hundred
 
When you set this option to true in the _lines.ini file (say *edit lines*):

:CODE:
[general]
line numbers modulo hundred = T
::

You will be able to use this feature for Excel, win32pad and ultraedit right now. The clue is in the link(/features/actions/actionclassesforapplications.html, actions classes), which can provide, per application, the calling grammar with the current line number from the function *getCurrentLineNumber*. If this function does not return a valid number, this option is not available for the foreground application, as for example Komodo.

Note: for Emacs the line module hundred trick can be implemented by inserting the correct function, *mdl-goto-line-mod100* instead of *goto-line*.

 simpleactions

These are the actions like &lt;&lt;copy>>, &lt;&lt;cut>>, &lt;&lt;delete>>, &lt;&lt;duplicate>>, which can be investigated in the actions.ini file.


 move copy actions

These actions require some more tuning in some applications. Details will follow.
